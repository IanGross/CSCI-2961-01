10) One problem that interests me is a course planner. Currently there exists a project that allows you to schdule your classes per semester, but nothing that plans out your degree for your entire time at RPI. For example, pretend I am a Computer Science Major in my 2nd year. I want to know which semesters I can take the classes I need, and in what order based on pre-requirements. Some classes are only offered every-other semester. This course planner would help plan one's potential course schedule for their remaining years and help avoid any potential conflicts.
