reasons for open source software:
- The source code is open and availble for others to use and modify in their own projects
- allows for more customization of existing projects
- flexibility, less resource intensive
- open source liscenses keep the creator from being liable
- more documentation

reasons for proprietary software:
- venor professional support
- usually has some sort of help feature integrated or on the web
- easier for unskilled users, tailored for the market
- works better with your hardware
- code can't be modified by it's users
- more reliable, company is liable

reasons why a company and an individual might choose one or the other
- A company might choose proprietary in order to commercialize their product
- A company might choose open sorce so developers can help build the project and pitch feedback
- An individual might choose open source if they want peer reviews from more experienced developers
- An individual might choose proprietary for code protection and more secure licenses

which you would choose if you were doing a side project and why
- I would choose open source software because it is easier to obtain liscenses, easier to build a community and my code could be used by others
which you would choose if you were starting a company and why
- I would chose proprietary because I want my code to be private and I want to commercialize my product


What I fixed:
- I couldn't find any issues with OpenBSD... I'm not sure what I should do from here...

Why it is important to maintain good documentation:
- It's important to maintain good documentation so future users are able to understand how to use the product.
What you have learned from this lab
-  I learned that the OpenBSD FAQs have great grammar and their links work
-  I learned that anyone can contribute to fixing mistakes in their documentation.
